Machine Setup Tool
==================

Machine Setup Tool provides ability to configure a BSP image for a particular
platform or machine. At the boot time, it customizes a BSP OS image
with the provided machine configuration. It also has ability to select the
target platform at boot time.

The development of this utility has been inspired by the zaurusd project.


Supported features
==================

* Ability to provide the machine configuration files separately.
* Ability to provide a custom list of supported machine.
* Ability to select the target machine via prompt at boot time.
* Ability to specify and select a default machine configuration on timeout
  on the boot time prompt.
* Ability to reconfigure a previously configured image.
* The following configuration items can be specified for machines.
  * Formfactor configuration file
  * ALSA configuration file
  * ALSA state file
  * Xorg configuration file
  * Network interfaces configuration file
  * A list of kernel modules for automatic boottime loading
  * A list of kernel modules to blacklist from loading
  * Extra kernel boot parameters
  * Serial port configuration for syslinux bootloader
  * Serial port configuration for grub bootloader
  * List of additional setup scripts to run at setup time
  * List of boot scripts to run at every boot
  * Configuration and ability to reboot the image after the setup process


Usage
=====

No machine configuration is provided in the sources of the Machine Setup Tool.
Users are expected to create and maintain their machine configurations
separately. For reference a set of sample machine configurations are provided
in the config/sample/ directory of the sources. As seen in the sample, the
main machine configuration file is specified by name "mymachine.vars", which
specifies rest of the needed machine configuration files for that machine.

In addition to the machine configuration files provided in the
/etc/machinesetuptool/config directory the default settings for the tool must
be provided in the /etc/machinesetuptool/defaults file.


Future Development
==================

The framework of the tool is generic, and it can be easily expanded to support
additional features. These features are under consideration, and will be
added later.

Some of the further developments are:
* Support for more machine specific configuration settings
